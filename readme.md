# c-programming

This repo contains some weird code that I wrote in `C`

The programming language of gods, after `assembly` ofc.

### Warning

Please don't run any code.
My shitty code might make your computer bsod.

JK.

:)

**Run Via**

```
cl.exe code_{n}.c && del *.obj

# OR

gcc code_{n}.c -o code_{n}.exe

# THEN

code_{n}.exe
```
*Replace `n` with the name of the c file.*

I have also made a code runner

Compile the `makeshit.c` via this command

```ps
init.bat
```

It will generate a executable named ms.exe

now use this runner like this

```ps
ms.exe {n}
```

You can also clear the builds by this command

```ps
ms.exe clear
```
